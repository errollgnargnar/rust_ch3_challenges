# rust_ch3_challenges

## About
This code contains solutions to the 3 challenges at the end of Chapter 3 in the book "The Rust Programming Language".
The 3 challenges are seperated into 3 functions which are called in fn main();

## Disclaimer
I recommend not looking at the code until you have completed it yourself. If however you have pulled the last straw and think you have tried everything, then take a look at this code and then go back to trying it again until you get it.
